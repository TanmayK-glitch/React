How exactly we have to make the REST API

1. Its a JSON API
 - GET /users - List all users : We can also render this using HTML / React Docs. 
 - GET /users/1 - List the user with ID 1
 - GET /users/2 - List the user with ID 2

2. POST Route
 - POST /users - Create a new user

3. PATCH Route
 - PATCH /users/1 - Edit the user with ID 1

4. DELETE Route
 - DELETE /users/1 - Delete the user with ID 1
